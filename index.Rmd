<img src="images/home_image.jpg" style="width:75%">

I received a BS in Environmental Science and Engineering from Fudan University and I am currently a MS student in Biostatistics of Columbia University.
Travelling is my favorite! I have been to five continents except South America and Antarctica. 
Now I really enjoy exploring the biostatistic world and the real world!
